# emacsAsEditor
A fan of geany that can't find an equivalent FREE text editor in MacOS. Finally I am just setting up emacs so it can do what geany can with ease.

This repo is simply my .emacs and .emacs.d/ folder with everything you need to make emacs look like a modern text editor, as well as behave as a modern text editor (to a great extent). 

I basically want it to function like Geany. 

I tried Sublime and textmate, but they always had something I didn't like. Either a nagging LaTeX environment, or the inability to execute single java or python files, or Tab on a selection would replace text instead of indenting a block of text, etc. I even tried Atom, but that is really primitive still.

So, I am customizing emacs as I go. This repo is basically tracking my progress. I am pretty happy with what I have so far.
